## Inception
One day, after spending some hour(s) investigating how to flash my Zigbee coordinator, I thought
it might be a good idea to have a memo somewhere to keep track of the things I learned.
Shared memo indeed, so, that other people could find it and spend less time searching for the same.

In short, the idea is to create a blog which will be just a log of my findings, thoughts, and ideas.
If anyone is interested in anything I write here and have questions, feedback, whatever, feel free to contact
<a href="#" data-a="ma" data-b="ilto:" data-c="rom" data-d="an@sarak" data-e="vasa.c" data-f="om" onclick="window.location.href = this.dataset.a+this.dataset.b+this.dataset.c+this.dataset.d+this.dataset.e+this.dataset.f; return false;">me<a/>.

Let us see how it goes...
