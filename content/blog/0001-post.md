## Inception
One day, after spending some hour(s) investigating how to flash my Zigbee coordinator, I thought
it might be a good idea to have a memo somewhere to keep track of the things I learned.
Shared memo indeed, so, that other people could find it and spend less time searching for the same.

In short, the idea is to create an archive which will be just a log of my findings, thoughts, and ideas.

If anyone is interested in anything I write here and have questions, feedback, whatever, feel free to contact
<a href="#" data-a="ma" data-b="ilto:" data-c="rom" data-d="an@sarak" data-e="vasa.c" data-f="om" onclick="window.location.href = this.dataset.a+this.dataset.b+this.dataset.c+this.dataset.d+this.dataset.e+this.dataset.f; return false;">me<a/>.

Let us see how it goes...
